pwSafe can import data from other apps, provided the data conforms to either the comma-separated-values (CSV) or tab-separated-values (TXT) formats.

To import your data, follow these steps:

    Export your data to CSV format.
    Conform your data to the expected format (see below). You can use a spreadsheet editor like Excel or Numbers for that.
    On pwSafe, import your data using the "File", "Import..." menu functions or ⌘ + I keyboard shortcut.
    Securely delete the CSV or TXT file, because these are not encrypted.

The CSV or TXT formats must adhere to this rules:

    A title row as the first line in the text file.
    A delimiter to reinstate the 'newline' character in a multi-line Notes field and the period ('.'), if present, in the Title field. The delimiter is '»'.
    The title row may contain the following fields:
        Group/Title (eg. "group.subgroup.title")
        Username
        Password
        URL
        Created Time
        Password Modified Time
        Record Modified Time
        e-mail
        Protected Status
        Symbol list for password generation
        Notes
    Subsequent rows must contain an entry each, with the data fields ordered according to their appearance on the title row.
